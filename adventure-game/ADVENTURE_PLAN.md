# Planning

You're the general of an army tasked with setting up the defense of your city during a siege. 

## First decision: Information dilemma 

You receive information from scouts that a force will be flanking your position, but the reliability of the information is dubious at best.

* ### Line 1: Yes

  We are currently  positioned outside of the city, do we re-allocate a part of our forces to defend against the flank, but risk compromising our strength as a whole, or we can fall back to the city, but potentially put them at risk?

  * ### Line 1: [yes] -> Fall back - Win

    You retreat to the city and by repositioning to regain the advantage you successfully hold off the attack. 

  * ### Line 1: [No] -> Split forces - Lose

    By splitting your forces neither force is capable of successfully holding back the enemy. You lose many in a pyric victory.

* ### Line 1: [No] -> Line 2: Flanked

  The scouts were correct, and now our forces are in a horrible position. They're almost upon us, do we fall back to the city and risk collateral or reposition to counter the flank?

  * ### Line 2: Flanked -> Fall back

    We fall back and barely manage to escape.
    Unfortunately we are scattered and lost some 
    forces, do we initiate a counter strike to stall and destabilize their advance or risk being caught attempting to regroup?

    * ### Line 3: Flanked -> Fall Back -> Counter strike - Lose

      We end up not having enough forces to effectively stall the advance, we lose too much to attrition and are overrun.

    * ### Line 3: Flanked -> Fall Back -> Regroup - Win

      Though risky you recognize that we need every man we can get, we regroup successfully and hold off the attackers breaking the siege. Well done!


  * ## Line 2: Flanked -> Counter - Lose

    One of the oldest maneuvers in the book, the pincer, due to being surrounded the battle is too heavily to their advantage and we end up being overrun.
